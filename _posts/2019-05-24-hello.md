It's my first artical. 
Maybe I should sometime build a blog from scratch on my own.

{% highlight c++ %}
template<size_t age>
struct Study {
   const static value = ?;//Study is a must.
};
template<size_t age>
struct Think {
   const static value = ?;//Learning is not enough.
};
template<size_t age>
struct Joy {
   const static value = ?;//I love games.
};
template<size_t age>
struct Life {
   const static value = Life<age-1>::value + Study<age>::value + Think<age>::value + Joy<age>::value;
};
template<>
struct Life<0> {
   const static value = 0;
};
{% endhighlight %}
